1. Viewport
    Viewport is the visual part of the screen that the user can actually see.
    Ideally we want our page to adapt differebt sized screens. We want the headings. the images and the text to graw a little bit to fill the entire screen.
    And to do that we have to add a code in our head part

    <meta name="vieport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    but in addition to this line of code we can make actual changes we can make to our page to make it look a little better on different screens.
2. Media Queries
    One of those has to be done with media Queries.
3. Flexbox
    Flexbox is quite helpful if we have multiple elements that's we're all trying to display on the same page at the same time that 
that might overflow if we not careful about we do a responsive design.
4. Grids


    there are css libraries does our websites responsive and one of those called bootstrap.
